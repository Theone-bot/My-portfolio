          <h3>About Francisco</h3>
          <p>Why did I choose web development? Well I've always been interested in coding I had done some classes in high school on computer science and some coding. When I graduated I went to work in a warehouse for a while. After I went to college for computer science found out it wasn't for me so I dropped out. Then one day my brother told me we should try to do a bootcamp and that's how I joined Thinkful. Me and my brother always like to get on a call and talk about our codes to ask what's wrong with them.</p>
          <p>I try to go to the gym at least 5 days a week to feel good. With games, I don't play as much as I used to but I play now and then to just unwind.</p>
